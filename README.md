How It Works
RedditNarrator works by scraping publicly available Reddit posts based on the user’s input (such as subreddit or post URL), converting them into video format using text-to-speech technology, and providing the final video file. The app runs entirely locally, meaning no personal data is collected or sent to external servers.
